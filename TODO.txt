TODO: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~General~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ensure ENVI header b.b. is updated if using UAVSAR clip; 
nudge to get alignment bw UAVSAR and training data, 
look at rasterizing alg and make sure it's not adding extra space to the training area; 
*erosion of training data in arc/gdal,
set correct output path for training image stack/clip; 
output txt file to list orig file
name and number-class lookup; 
change output of training image to be in Train directory, 
why are training and veiwing images slightly offset?  resampling boundaries? 
(use NoData mask for training data: https://gdal.org/development/rfc/rfc15_nodatabitmask.html#rfc-15, but will need to copy mask_valid_pixels to XXX.msk); (convert to int16 precision to save memory); 
save arcmap viewing color files...; 
add cost functions...; 
noData mask for training;
turn off parallel except if on a cluster?
speckle filtering?
*run with only raw Freeman image ratios or inter-class variance
*Need better water and FD classes
*Run training for lots of param options and figure out which ones most imp- then use those
*Better training data! Then re-run trainingImiageImport.m
*Add Lee filter (wiener2.m)
*Remove some of the filters from sigma: i.e. Hess
After AGU: add NoData class, *log-transform data?, use translation features?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PixelClassifier~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO: change plotting for n-band images; 
test w multiple imgs in training dir (maybe set to load indiv training image sets into mem one at a time); 
circumvent output method of writing to sep files, then combining- just combine on the first try (in pixelclassifier.m); (save output training diagram/image to folder)
mirror window in movingstd instead of shrink...
k-fold cross val for number of leaves?
Memory optimization/block proc, if necessary
Make addOutputImages.m more general by removing function calls to env
Update fileexchange script for the following with gif fix: D:\Dropbox\Matlab\DownloadedCode\CaptureFigVid\CaptureFigVid\CaptureFigVid_EK.m
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LINUX~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
prep trainingImageImport.m to be like viewingImageImport.m

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~DONE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
add bounding box input to create smaller training file tif, reproject,
run with only raw Freeman images
add moving std feature
test training using 3 bands!; 
modify to work on n-band images, 
how to do deal w empty files for empty training classes; 
automate bounding box selection
*What percentage of  training px are being used? A: <1
*making confusion matrix; 
re-plot histograms to better align by band


~~~~~~~~~~Modify for re-distribution of PixelClassifier Code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rfTrain.m
pixelClassifierTrain.m - validition and concat of n=3 bandns to make F
