TODO: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~General~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ensure ENVI header b.b. is updated if using UAVSAR clip; 
modify to work on n-band images, nudge to get alignment bw UAVSAR and
training data, 
look at rasterizing alg and make sure it's not adding extra space to the training area; 
erosion of training data in arc/gdal,
set correct output path for training image stack/clip; 
how to do deal w empty files for empty training classes; 
output txt file to list orig file
name and number-class lookup; 
change output of training image to be in
Train directory, automate bounding box selection?; 
why are training and veiwing images slightly offset?  resampling boundaries? 
(use NoData mask for training data: https://gdal.org/development/rfc/rfc15_nodatabitmask.html#rfc-15, but will need to copy mask_valid_pixels to XXX.msk); (convert to int16 precision to save memory); 
test training using 3 bands!; 
add speckle filter?; 
making confusion matrix; 
save arcmap viewing color files...; 
add cost functions...; 
noData mask for training;
turn off parallel except if on a cluster?
add moving std feature

DONE: 

add bounding box input to create smaller training file tif, reproject,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PixelClassifier~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO: change plotting for n-band images; 
test w multiple imgs in training dir (maybe set to load indiv training image sets into mem one at a time); 
circumvent output method of writing to sep files, then combining- just combine on the first try (in pixelclassifier.m); (save output training diagram/image to folder)
